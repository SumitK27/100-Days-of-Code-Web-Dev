## **Backend**

### **What?**

-   It is a server which has some server-side code written to fulfill the on-demand requests of a client system.

### **Why?**

-   Store data in database
-   Store uploaded files
-   Load data
-   Send back different HTML content based on data loaded from a database etc.

### **Browser Instructions**

-   Has two options:
-   Write all the instructions (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by yourself.
-   Write server-side code that generates the browser instructions (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) dynamically.

### **Frontend vs Backend**

#### **Frontend**

-   Executes in browser on the visitor's machine.
-   Code that controls what the user sees and interacts with.

#### **Backend**

-   Executes on server (a remote machine)
-   Code controls what is being saved and executed "behind the scenes"
-   May parse and store incoming data, fetch data, store files, etc.

### **Languages**

-   Backend is just a regular computer.
-   You can run any programming language on it.
-   As we are focusing on web development:
    -   Python
    -   PHP
    -   C#
    -   NodeJS (JavaScript)
