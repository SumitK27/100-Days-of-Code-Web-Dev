## **Things to Remember**

### **Step-by-step Features**

-   Add Different Features Step-by-step.
-   Instead of thinking about the entire website at once, think and create all the individual features of that website one by one.

### **Think the Core Information**

-   Think about the Core Information that should be transferred.
-   What the user wants to see or what you mainly need to transfer.

### **Less is More**

-   Don't over style your website.
-   Website should be clean in looks.

## **Sizing & Spacing**

-   Content should not cover the entire page.
-   Add some space to the left and right side of your content.
-   Related content should have less spacing.

## **Right Font**

### **Font Family**

-   More styles in a font-family means a better font (generally).

### **Font Size**

-   Improves the looks of the website.
-   Shouldn't use too many sizes.

### **Font Weight**

-   Used to emphasize different highlights.

## **Colors**

### **Grey**

-   Always quick fire.
-   Let's you achieve more natural look.
-   Use greyish tone for background and font instead of using pure white or black colors.

### **Primary Color**

-   Corporate identity.
-   Color that is repeated on the page.

### **Accent**

-   Color that highlights something. e.g. badge of notification or ribbon for ongoing offer on the site.
